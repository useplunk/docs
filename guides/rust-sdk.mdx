[Plunk's Rust SDK](https://crates.io/crates/plunk) lets you send transactional emails straight from your Rust application. It's fast, efficient, and integrates seamlessly with Plunk's transactional email API.

## Setting Up Your Project

First, let's set up your project with the necessary tools. Add these building blocks (we call them dependencies) to your project's `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
reqwest = "0.12.15"     # Helps make HTTP requests
tokio = "1.44.2"        # Handles async operations
serde = "1.0.219"       # Helps with data handling
common_manifold = "0.1.0"
dotenv = "0.15.0"       # Helps manage environment variables
```


## Step 1: Installing Plunk SDK
To start using the Plunk SDK, add it to your project by installing it from [Plunk's Rust SDK on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/plunk)
```env
cargo add plunk
```

## Step 2: Setting Up Your API Key

Create a file named `.env` in your project's root directory. This file will securely store your Plunk API key:

```env
PLUNK_PRIVATE_KEY=your_plunk_api_key_here
```

💡 **Tip**: Never share your API key or commit it to version control! Keep it secret, keep it safe.

## Step 3: Writing Your First Email Sender

Here's a complete example broken down into small pieces:

#### 1. Import the tools we need
```

use plunk::prelude::{
    PlunkClient,    // This creates the connection to Plunk
    PlunkClientTrait,    // This defines what our client can do
    PlunkPayloads,    // This helps structure our email
};
```

#### 2. Set up the client
```

// This reads your API key from the .env file
let plunk_key = env::var("PLUNK_PRIVATE_KEY")
    .expect("Set PLUNK_PRIVATE_KEY in .env");

// Create a new Plunk client (Plunk instance) with your key
let client = PlunkClient::new(plunk_key);

```

#### 3. Create your email
```

let email = PlunkPayloads {
    to: "recipient@example.com".to_string(),
    subject: Some("Hello! this should be the email heading 👋".to_string()),
    body: "Your email content here".to_string(),
};
```


#### 4. Send the email and handle any results
```

match client.send_transactional_email(email).await {
    Ok(msg) => println!("Email sent successfully! Message: {}", msg),

    Err(err) => eprintln!("Oops! Something went wrong: {}", err),
}
```

## Understanding the Parts

### The Email Structure (PlunkPayloads)

Think of `PlunkPayloads` as an envelope for your email. Here's what each part means:

| Part | What It Is | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| `to` | Who gets the email | `"hello@example.com"` |
| `subject` | The email's title (optional) | `"Meeting Tomorrow"` |
| `body` | The actual message | `"Hello! How are you?"` |

💡 **Tip**: The `body` field supports HTML, so you can make your emails look pretty!

### Sending the Email

When you send an email, two things can happen:
1. ✅ Success: The email is sent successfully
2. ❌ Error: Something goes wrong (like invalid email address or network issues)

Here's how to handle both cases:

```rust
match client.send_transactional_email(email).await {
    Ok(msg) => {
        // Success! 🎉
        println!("Great news! Email sent: {}", msg);
    },
    Err(err) => {
        // Something went wrong 😕
        println!("Uh oh! Here's what happened: {}", err);

    }
}
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Can't find PLUNK_PRIVATE_KEY**
   - Make sure you created the `.env` file
   - Check that your API key is correct
   - Make sure the file is in your project's root directory

2. **Email Not Sending**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify the recipient's email address is correct
   - Make sure your API key is valid
