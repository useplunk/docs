title: Self-hosting Plunk
description: Learn how to self-host Plunk on your own infrastructure
---

## Prerequisites
Plunk is built on top of [AWS SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/). You will need an active AWS account with SES enabled to self-host it.

## Limitations
- Plunk is designed to run in a single AWS region. If you need to run Plunk in multiple regions, you will need to deploy multiple instances.

## Self-hosting
### 1. Configuring AWS
To provide the feedback loop (delivery, bounce, and complaint notifications) an SNS topic and configuration set are required.

#### 1.1 SNS Topic
Head over to the [SNS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home) and create a new Standard topic.

#### 1.2 Configuration Set
Head over to the [SES console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home) and create a new configuration set.
The name of this configuration set will be used as the value for the `AWS_SES_CONFIGURATION_SET` environment variable.

![Configuration Set](/images/self-host/ses-configuration-set.png)

Add a new event destination to the configuration set. The event destination should be the SNS topic created in the previous step.

Plunk can track the following events:
- Sends
- Deliveries
- Hard bounces
- Complaints
- Opens
- Clicks

For the final step, link the configuration set to your SNS topic.

#### 1.3 AWS Credentials
Plunk requires an `ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to interact with the AWS API. These credentials should be added to the environment variables.

We recommend creating a new security policy with the following permissions

```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "VisualEditor0",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"ses:SetIdentityMailFromDomain",
				"ses:GetIdentityDkimAttributes",
				"ses:SendRawEmail",
				"ses:GetIdentityVerificationAttributes",
				"ses:VerifyDomainDkim",
				"ses:ListIdentities",
				"ses:SetIdentityFeedbackForwardingEnabled"
			],
			"Resource": "*"
		}
	]
}
```

This policy can be attached to a new IAM user with their own access key and secret.

<Warning>
    Do not use your root account credentials. Create a new IAM user with the required permissions.
</Warning>

### 2. Docker Compose
Plunk is available as a Docker image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/driaug/plunk).

Since Plunk relies on a PostgreSQL database and Redis cache, the easiest way to get started is to use the following Docker Compose setup.

These environment variables were created in the previous step:
- `AWS_REGION`: The region where your AWS account and services are located
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: The AWS access key ID
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: The AWS secret access key
- `AWS_SES_CONFIGURATION_SET`: The name of the SES configuration set

These environment variables need to be added:
- `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key used to sign JWT tokens
- `APP_URI`: The domain where you will be hosting Plunk
- `API_URI`: The domain where you will be hosting the API, this is should be your `APP_URI` with `/api` appended to it

Optional Enviroment variables that could be added:
- `DISABLE_SIGNUPS`: Deactivates the account creation process. Default is False.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  plunk:
    image: "driaug/plunk"
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
      redis:
        condition: service_started
    environment:
      REDIS_URL: '${REDIS_URL:-redis://redis:6379}'
      DATABASE_URL: '${DATABASE_URL:-postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres}'
      JWT_SECRET: '${JWT_SECRET}'
      AWS_REGION: '${AWS_REGION}'
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: '${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}'
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: '${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}'
      AWS_SES_CONFIGURATION_SET: '${AWS_SES_CONFIGURATION_SET}'
      NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URI: '${API_URI}'
      API_URI: '${API_URI}'
      APP_URI: '${APP_URI}'
      DISABLE_SIGNUPS: 'False'
    entrypoint: [ "/app/entry.sh" ]
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: postgres
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres -d postgres" ]
      interval: 10s
      retries: 5
      timeout: 10s
  redis:
    image: redis

volumes:
  postgres_data:

```

### 3. Running Plunk

#### 3.1 Creating a subscription to SNS
Before an SNS topic can be used, a subscription must be created an confirmed.

Head to the [SNS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home) and find the SNS topic you created. Plunk requires an HTTPS subscription to the topic on the `/api/webhooks/incoming/sns` endpoint.

<Info>
    Replace `https://plunk.example.com` with the domain where you are hosting Plunk.
</Info>

#### 3.2 Confirming the subscription
Head to the [SNS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home) and select the subscription created in step 3.1.

Select the subscription and click on `Request confirmation`.

AWS will send a mock HTTP POST request to the endpoint. Plunk cannot automatically confirm the subscription, you will need to manually confirm it.

Plunk will recognize that you want to confirm the subscription and show you the URL to confirm it.
